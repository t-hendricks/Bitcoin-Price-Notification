# Bitcoin Price Notification
Cryptocurrency is the new wave of digital currency. Bitcoin has and still is gaining a lot of attention. Therefore, I decided to build a Python app to send me updates on the current price of Bitcoins. I used the Coinmarket API to gather Bitcoin's price information and connect the Python app to the IFTTT ("if this, then that") web service, so that I can send information to both mobile and email platforms.
