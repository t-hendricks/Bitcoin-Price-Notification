# Bitcoin Price Notification
Cryptocurrency is the new wave of digital currency. Bitcoin has and still is gaining a lot of attention. Therefore, I decided to build a basic Python terminal application to send updates on the current price of Bitcoins. I used the Coinmarketcap's API to gather Bitcoin's price information and connect the Python app to the IFTTT ("if this, then that") web service, so that I can send information to both mobile and email platforms.

# What I learned
